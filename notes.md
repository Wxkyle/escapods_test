1. Initialize a NextJS app in a new git repo that you host on your personal account
2. Connect your NextJS app to the public Star Wars API aka SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/) using your preferred fetch method
3. You create 5 page routes using NextJS's routing dynamic routing conventions:
   1. Home page – displays a simple welcome text message
   2. Planets Index page – located at /planets and displays a grid/list of first page of planets from SWAPI's planets endpoint
   3. Planets Detail page – located at /planets/[id] and displays basic information about the planet (details found on the planet's JSON object)
   4. People Index page – located at /people and display a grid/list of people (characters) from the first page of the SWAPI's people endpoint
   5. People Detail page – located at /people/[id] and displays basic information about the person/character
4. You implement a basic navigation element that's present on every route that allows you to return to the Home page or the Planets and People index pages.
5. You send me the git repo when finished so that I can simply clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the app.
